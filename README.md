# Book Management System

## Overview

The Book Management System is a simple Java application designed to manage and display book information. It interfaces with a Microsoft Access database to retrieve data about books, including their titles, authors, and prices, and then displays this information. This project demonstrates basic database operations in Java, such as connecting to a database, executing a SQL query, and processing result sets.

## Features

- **Database Connectivity**: Connects to a Microsoft Access database using JDBC.
- **Book Information Retrieval**: Retrieves book information from the database and stores it in Java objects.
- **Display Book Information**: Prints details of all books retrieved from the database, including titles, authors, and prices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- Microsoft Access or a compatible DBMS installed.
- The database file `BookDB.accdb` setup with a `Books` table.
